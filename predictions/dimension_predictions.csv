To verify whether our design complies with Rule V.1.2, we need to measure the wheelbase of our vehicle in the engineering drawing. A wheelbase is the distance between the front and rear wheels of a vehicle. In the engineering drawing, the wheels are located at the bottom, and the wheelbase can be measured as the length of the vehicle in the horizontal direction.

To do this, we can use the scale bar at the top of the drawing. First, we need to identify the position of the front wheel and rear wheel in the drawing. Then, we can use the scale bar to convert the measurement into millimeters. If the length of the vehicle in the horizontal direction is at least 1525 mm, our design will comply with the wheelbase requirement specified in Rule V.1.2."

To determine whether the design complies with rule V.4.1, we need to measure the diameter of the vehicle's wheel in the engineering drawing. We can do this by measuring the distance from the center of the wheel to its outer edge. The scale bar in the engineering drawing shows that the drawing is in millimeters (mm). To convert the wheel diameter from millimeters to inches, we can multiply the measurement by 0.001.

We can use any of the six CAD views to obtain the wheel diameter measurement. For example, we can use the first CAD view on the left, which shows the vehicle from the front. To measure the wheel diameter, we can use the measurement tool in our CAD software to measure the distance from the center of the wheel to its outer edge. This measurement will provide the wheel diameter in millimeters.

Once we have obtained the wheel diameter measurement, we can compare it to the required wheel diameter specified in the FSAE rule document, which is 203.2 mm or more. If the measurement meets or exceeds the requirement, then our design complies with rule V.4.1.

To check compliance with Rule F.5.7.6, we need to calculate the inclination of the Front Hoop above the Upper Side Impact Structure. The Front Hoop's inclination is calculated as the angle between a hypothetical line perpendicular to the floor and the intersection of the Front Hoop with that line. The angle must be less than 20° from the vertical.

Using the scale bar provided, we can determine the dimensions of the Front Hoop. First, we need to compute the height of the Front Hoop above the Upper Side Impact Structure. We can do this by subtracting the dimension of the Upper Side Impact Structure from the dimension of the Front Hoop. Once we have the height, we can calculate the angle of the inclination by taking the sine of the angle.

The engineering drawing of our vehicle shows that the Front Hoop Braces are attached as near as possible to the top of the Front Hoop. The drawing does not provide an exact measurement for the distance between the Front Hoop and the Front Hoop Braces. However, it is clear that the Front Hoop Braces are attached as near as possible to the top of the Front Hoop, which is a requirement of rule F.6.3.4. Therefore, our design complies with this rule.

To determine whether our design complies with rule F.3.2.1g, we will examine the dimensions of the main hoop in relation to the steel tube size A dimension specified in the rules. The main hoop in our design is made of a steel tube. The engineering drawing shows that the main hoop's dimensions are 25mm in diameter, which corresponds to size A. The main hoop's size A dimension is 12.5 mm. Since the main hoop's size A dimension is smaller than the steel tube's size A dimension (25 mm), our design complies with rule F.3.2.1g.

First, I will analyze the main hoop's size according to the FSAE rules. The main hoop appears to be a steel tube with a size of A. However, according to rule F.3.2.1g, the main hoop must meet size per F.3.4.1. A comparison between the main hoop size and the size per F.3.4.1 is necessary to determine compliance.

Next, I will check the driver restraint harness attachment size. Rule F.3.2.1g requires that the main hoop must meet alternative tubing material per F.3.5. However, this rule does not apply in this case, as the main hoop is made of a steel tube.

Finally, I will analyze the side impact structure's size. The FSAE rules do not provide any specific requirements for the side impact structure's size. Therefore, the side impact structure's size is not relevant to the question.

To answer the question, we will analyze the main hoop's size and determine whether it complies with rule F.3.2.1g (which references F.3.4.1) specified in the FSAE rule document. The size of the main hoop is given in the engineering drawing, and we will use the scale bar to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.
As per the FSAE rules, the main hoop must meet size per F.3.4: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p.
The main hoop in the image is made of a steel tube. Let's assume the main hoop is made of a steel tube with its size given as A.
F.3.4.1 states that the main hoop must have a size of at least D. To meet this requirement, we must check if the size A is greater than or equal to size D.
Since the main hoop is made of a steel tube, we can measure its size using the scale bar to determine if it meets the requirement of size D as specified in the rules.

However, the image does not provide any information about the scatter shield's width or alignment with the chain. Based on the image, we cannot confidently determine whether the scatter shield is centered on the chain or if it complies with rule T.5.2.7c. Finally, since the image does not provide any information about the scatter shield's alignment with the chain under all conditions, we cannot confidently determine if it complies with rule T.5.2.7d.

In the FSAE rules document, rule T.5.2.7b states that scatter shields for chains must have a minimum width equal to three times the width of the chain. In this image, the chain width is 13 mm. To determine whether our powertrain design complies with this rule, we need to find the width of the scatter shield. The engineering drawing shows a scattershield made from steel, and we can use the scale bar to convert the dimensions to millimeters.

Using the scale bar, the scattershield's width can be determined as follows:
1 unit on the scale bar = 1 mm (since the drawing units are in millimeters)
The scattershield's width, as shown on the engineering drawing, is 25 mm
Therefore, the width of the scattershield should be at least 75 mm (3 times the width of the chain). However, the image does not provide enough information to determine the exact width of the scattershield.

Based on the information available in the image, we cannot confidently say that our design complies with rule T.5.2.7b. To ensure compliance, additional information about the scattershield's dimensions would be necessary."

To comply with rule T.7.5.b, we must ensure that the vehicle's dimensions meet the minimum requirements specified in the FSAE rule document. Since the engineering drawing is in millimeters, we must use the scale bar to convert these measurements into metric units. The scale bar is 10mm/mm, so we can determine the length of the vehicle in millimeters by dividing the length displayed in the drawing by 10.

The length of the vehicle in the engineering drawing is 600mm. Therefore, the length of the vehicle in millimeters is:
600mm / 10mm = 600mm

To comply with rule T.7.5.b, the length of the vehicle must be at least 3600mm. Since the length of the vehicle in the engineering drawing is 600mm, which is less than the minimum requirement of 3600mm, we must make adjustments to the design to meet the rule's requirements.

Explanation:
To determine if our design complies with rule T.7.6.3, we need to examine whether the rear wing extends beyond the rear wheel axles and if it is mounted in a horizontal plane at the minimum height of 50 mm above the ground, using the engineering drawing.

First, we need to identify the rear wheel axles from the engineering drawing. Since the scale bar is provided at the top of the drawing, we can measure the distance between the rear wheel axles.

Next, we can determine the height of our design by measuring the distance from the ground to the bottom edge of the rear wing. If this distance is greater than or equal to 50 mm, we can conclude that the rear wing is mounted in a horizontal plane and meets the height requirement.

Finally, we need to check whether the rear wing extends beyond the rear wheel axles. To do this, we can compare the width of the rear wing to the width of the rear wheel axles in the engineering drawing.
