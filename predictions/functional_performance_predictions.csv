The image shows the FEA simulation results for a battery structure composed of non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The simulation results indicate that the structure has a stress of -550 MPa and a strain of -47.56 MPa. Rule F.3.5.3b requires that the Young's Modulus (E) for non-welded aluminum alloy 6061-T6 must be 69 GPa (10,000 ksi). The negative stress and strain values in the image suggest that the structure may not meet this requirement. However, the image does not provide information on the equivalent yield strength or whether the structure has been properly solution heat treated or subjected to heating during team manufacturing. Therefore, it is unclear whether the structure can be used in the vehicle. The team should consult with a materials expert or conduct further testing to determine the suitability of the structure."

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current. Based on this image and rule EV.5.8.4 in the rule document, can we use the resistor for TSMP? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,5.png,"EV.5.8.4a states that accumulator max voltage between 200 and 400 volts requires a 10kOhm resistor. The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation:
The image shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. These values are well within the voltage ranges stipulated by the FSAE rules. Hence, a 10 kOhm resistor is amply sufficient to limit the current in the TSMP. The continuous power rating of the resistor also meets the requirements of the rule. Additionally, the direct measurement of the resistor's value is possible during the Electrical Technical Inspection. Therefore, we can use the 10 kOhm resistor for TSMP.

The image shows the max voltage is in this 400 to 600 range, so a 15kOhm resistor (and not an 10 kOhm resistor) is needed.","Explanation:
The image shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time, and we need to determine whether we can use the 10 kOhm resistor for TSMP as per the rules. First, we must find the maximum TS voltage (Vmax) in the image. In this case, the maximum voltage is 200V DC. Based on the rule, the resistor value should be 5 kOhm since the voltage is less than or equal to 200 V DC. Thus, we can use the 10 kOhm resistor for TSMP. However, we need to confirm the continuous power rating and ensure the resistor can be directly measured during the Electrical Technical Inspection.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments.

The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load is less than 60 kN, so this impact attenuator can be used.","Given Explanation:
Standard honeycomb Impact Attenuator is a type of Impact Attenuator that is designed to absorb and displace the force of impacts during the vehicle's operation. The force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator is a graph that shows the relationship between the force applied to the impact attenuator and the resulting displacement. This curve is obtained from experiments and is essential for evaluating the performance of the impact attenuator. Rule F.8.7.2 specifies the peak load requirements for different types of impact attenuators, and based on these requirements, it is possible to determine the suitability of the impact attenuator for the vehicle.

Explanation:
The force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments is essential for evaluating the performance of the impact attenuator. If the impact attenuator is a standard honeycomb type, and the peak load for this type of impact attenuator is within the limits specified in rule F.8.7.2, then the impact attenuator can be used in the vehicle. To determine if the peak load for the standard honeycomb impact attenuator is within the limits, the force-displacement curve should be compared to the peak load requirements specified in rule F.8.7.2.

The image shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator, which is a standard honeycomb type. The curve suggests that the impact attenuator is capable of withstanding a peak load of 60 kN. While rule F.8.7.2 in the FSAE rules document indicates that the peak load for a standard honeycomb impact attenuator is 95 kN, the measured peak load in the image is only 60 kN. However, it is important to note that the rules document states that the peak load for a tested impact attenuator is the peak as measured. In this case, since the image shows the actual peak load measured from the impact attenuator, it should be acceptable for use in the vehicle.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on an assembly of frame tubes. The frame tubes are made from welded steel tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.4.2b in the rule document, should we use the assembly in the vehicle? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",no,9.png,"F.3.4.2b states that the yield strength of welded steel is 180 MPa. The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 250 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength. Therefore this assembly should not be used.","Explanation:
Since the FEA simulation results are presented, it is crucial to evaluate the validity of the simulation and the properties of the steel tubing. Rule F.3.4.2b shows that for welded steel tubing, the yield strength should be 180 MPa and the ultimate strength should be 300 MPa. 
Based on the FEA simulation results, we can see that the yield strength is 42.9 ksi, and the ultimate strength is 52.9 ksi. These values are higher than those suggested by rule F.3.4.2b. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the assembly of frame tubes is not suitable for the vehicle, as the steel tubing used does not meet the specific welded steel tubing properties outlined in the rule.

Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,15.png,The stress on the frame does not exceed the yield stress of 240 Mpa.,"Explanation:
The image shows that the motor mount, which is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, has passed an FEA simulation. By examining the results, we can determine if the motor mount can be used in the vehicle. Rule F.3.5.3b a provides the minimum wall thickness for non-welded aluminum tubing. The aluminum tubing in the motor mount meets this requirement.

Additionally, rule F.3.5.3b c requires the Young's Modulus (E), Yield Strength (Sy), and Ultimate Strength (Su) for the aluminum alloy 6061-T6 in the SES calculations. The aluminum tubing in the motor mount meets these requirements.

However, rule F.3.5.3c states that if welding is used on a regulated aluminum structure, the equivalent yield strength must be considered in the ""as welded"" condition for the alloy used, unless the team provides detailed proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated, artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufacturing.

The image shows a motor mount which is a critical component in connecting the motor to the structural frame. The frame is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The FEA simulation results indicate that the mount is subjected to significant stress and strain. The stress and strain values indicate that the mount is experiencing conditions beyond the yield strength and possibly approaching the ultimate strength of the aluminum tubing.

In rule F.3.5.3b, the minimum wall thickness for non-welded aluminum tubing is specified. The rule also specifies the non-welded properties of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in a SES. According to the rule, the yield strength for non-welded aluminum tubing should not be exceeded in the “as welded” condition. The fact that the simulation results indicate the motor mount is experiencing stress and strain values close to the ultimate strength suggests that the mount may be approaching its yield strength limit in the non-welded condition.

Therefore, based on the FEA simulation results and the rule context, it is not recommended to use the motor mount in the vehicle. The team must consider how to redesign the motor mount or find an alternative solution that complies with the F"
