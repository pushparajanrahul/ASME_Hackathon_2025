The image shows the results of a FEA simulation on the battery structure's non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. The Young's Modulus (E) and Ultimate Strength (Su) values in the image meet the minimum requirements for the non-welded properties as specified in rule F.3.5.3b. However, the Yield Strength (Sy) value does not meet the minimum requirement of 240 MPa.

In rule F.3.5.3b, it is stated that if the frame or component is properly solution heat treated and artificially aged, the equivalent yield strength must be considered in the ""as welded"" condition for the alloy used. The team must supply evidence as to how the process was performed, including the heat treating facility used, the process applied, and the fixturing used.

Given the information available, it is likely that the team has used welding on the battery structure, as they have not provided evidence of proper solution heat treating and artificially aging. Therefore, the team must ensure that the equivalent yield strength is considered in the ""as welded"" condition for the alloy used, or they must provide proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated, artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufact"

The image shows a battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Since the tubing is non-welded, its properties should be considered as per rule F.3.5.3b. The Young's Modulus (E) should be 69 GPa (10,0000 ksi), Yield Strength (Sy) should be 240 MPa (34.8 ksi), and Ultimate Strength (Su) should be 290 MPa (42.1 ksi). In addition, the equivalent yield strength must be considered in the ""as welded"" condition for the alloy used unless the team provides detailed proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated, artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufacturing. If aluminum was solution heat treated and age hardened to increase its strength after welding, the team must supply evidence as to how the process was performed, including the heat treating facility used, the process applied, and the fixturing used.

"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current. Based on this image and rule EV.5.8.4 in the rule document, can we use the resistor for TSMP? First provide an explanation for your answer (begin it with ‘Explanation:’). Then provide just a yes/no answer (begin it with ‘Answer:’) that summarizes your response.",yes,5.png,"EV.5.8.4a states that accumulator max voltage between 200 and 400 volts requires a 10kOhm resistor. The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Explanation:
In the image, the calculated values of TS voltage over time are shown. Rule EV.5.8.4 requires a resistor to be used to limit the current for TSMP. The maximum TS voltage is given as 600V DC. The resistor value must be sized according to the rule's requirements. In this case, the resistor should have a continuous power rating of more than the power dissipated across the TSMPs if they are shorted together. A 10 kOhm resistor is not suitable for this purpose as it falls short of the required resistor value according to the rule. Therefore, the answer is no."

The image shows the max voltage is in this 400 to 600 range, so a 15kOhm resistor (and not an 10 kOhm resistor) is needed.","Explanation:
In the image, the TS voltage is plotted over time. It is important to note that this image is not directly related to the FSAE rules for TSMP. However, the rules do require a current limiting resistor for any TSMP. If the TS voltage is to be measured using a TSMP, and a resistor value must be chosen based on the maximum TS voltage, then the resistor value should be chosen such that it meets the requirements of rule EV.5.8.4. In this case, the resistor value should be 10 kOhm since the maximum TS voltage is 200 V DC. However, since the FSAE rules do not specifically require the use of a TS voltage measurement for TSMPs, we can take into consideration the rules in the context of the competition."

The provided image shows the force-displacement curve of a standard honeycomb type impact attenuator. The curve is used to determine the peak load for the impact attenuator. Rule F.8.7.2 in the FSAE rules document specifies the peak load for different types of impact attenuators.

The simulation results show that the welded steel tubes meet the yield and ultimate strength requirements. However, the welded tubes used in the vehicle must also meet the Young's modulus requirement. Since Young's modulus is not a requirement in the FSAE rules document, the vehicle may use the assembly of frame tubes.

The FEA simulation results show that the assembly of frame tubes has a yield strength of 180 MPa and an ultimate strength of 300 MPa. Rule F.3.4.2b states that the yield strength for discontinuous material such as joint calculations should be 180 MPa, while the ultimate strength should be 300 MPa.

The image shows the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. The force value of 103.7 N/m is applied, and the stress on the pedal slats is calculated. Based on the FSAE rule T.3.2.2, it is required that the brake pedal and associated components must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure. The force applied in this image is only 103.7 N/m, which is much lower than the required minimum force of 2000 N. Therefore, the inputs in the analysis are not correct.

The rule requires the pedal to withstand 2000 N of force without any failure of the brake system, pedal box, chassis mounting, or pedal adjustment. The image shows the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. It is important to note that the force applied on the pedal is not the same as the force the pedal needs to withstand. The force on the pedal is the impact force, whereas the force that the pedal needs to withstand is the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally. Based on this information, the correct inputs in the analysis were the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally, not the force applied on the pedal. The image shows the stress on the pedal slats due to that force, but it does not directly address the rule's requirements. Therefore, the answer is no."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document.

The image shows that the gearbox temperature does not surpass 60 degrees C, so insulation can be omitted.","Explanation:
As per rule T.1.6.1, the driver should not come in contact with any metal or materials that may have a surface temperature above 60°C. Since the image shows that the gearbox components temperature is measured over time, and it does not show the driver's direct contact with the gearbox, it can be inferred that the insulation provided to the gearbox is sufficient. Therefore, it would be safe to omit insulation around the gearbox as per the rule.

As per the given image, the mount is made of aluminum tubing that has been FEA simulated. The image shows the results of the simulation, which indicate that the stress levels are below the yield strength of the aluminum tubing. This suggests that the motor mount is safe to use in the vehicle.

Explanation:
FEA simulation is a computer-based method of analyzing the structural behavior of a vehicle component under various loading conditions. In this case, the stress levels in the motor mount have been simulated, and the results show that the stress levels are within the allowable limits of the aluminum tubing's properties. Rule F.3.5.3b states that the non-welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 must meet specific minimum values for yield and ultimate strength. The FEA simulation results in the given image confirm that the stress levels in the motor mount are below the yield strength of the aluminum tubing, indicating that it is safe to use in the vehicle.

The image shows that the frame is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, and the FEA simulation results indicate the frame might not meet the minimum requirements set by the FSAE competition rules. The Young's Modulus (E) and Ultimate Strength (Su) for the aluminum tubing in an SES must be at least 69 GPa and 290 MPa, respectively. However, the simulation results show that these requirements are not met. Therefore, it is not advisable to use the motor mount in the vehicle.
